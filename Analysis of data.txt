Analysing our data

-Identify certain characteristics which cause significantly higher risk of PII

-Chloropleth maps to show areas of higher risk to visualise data if geopandas becomes avalible

-Consider correlations between characteristics in calculations

-Flag areas where selected characteristics lead to 10 or fewer people in a particular area

-Which PII is more sensitive than others- analyse which factors both create higher risk and are sensitive
  -consider not publishing more sensitive PII
  -have 'other' column for more identifiable data/ characteristics which few people occupy; decreases risk of PII
